<div style = 'text-align: justify'>It can be observed, that until 1970s the crime rates were increasing, to achieve peaks around 1980, flatten and start dropping in 1990s. By 2000 the crime rates returned to values similar to those at the beginning of the measurement, in 1960. Such a shape of the graph might be connected with the high unemployment rate in the years 1970 - 1985. The inflation rate was also considerable (13.3% in 1979 https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093) during the time with the increased crime rates. The years for which the data has been collected encompass a period of escalating tension between the USA and the Soviet Union. This situation obviously exerted an enormous impact on the economy and politics. 
The increased crime rates in the second half of the 20th century may be connected with the military conflicts that the USA were engaged in. There is a hipothesis that societies experience increased civil violence after participating in wars and also uphold a legitimation of violence model (https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/increases-us-violent-crime-during-1980s-following-four-american). In the years 1963 - 1975 the American army was involved in the Vietnam war - the conflict being still vivid in the nation's memory. In 1979 it participated in the Soviet-Afghan war, in 1982-1984 in the Lebanese Civil War, in 1983 the Army took part in the invasion of Grenada and in 1989 - 1990 in the invasion of Panama, to name but a few. 
After the attacks on 9/11, the rate of white-collar crimes (the full range of frauds committed by business and government professionals) increased, due to rellocation of the FBI resources to fight with terrorism (https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/white-collar-crime-enforcement). It is possible that also other kinds of crimes could become more frequent. 
Worth mentioning is that in the USA quite high rates of discrimination against race or ethnicity are still observed and they also may contribute to the crime rate.

To decreasing crime rates contribute decreasing homelessness (by 16% in the years 2007-2019) and poverty (decreased by around 3% to 12.5% in the years 2010 - 2020) (https://my.neighbor.org/california-homelessness-statistics/#:~:text=Homelessness%20in%20California,-Each%20night%20more&text=In%20the%20last%20point-in,entirety%20of%20the%20United%20States.).
The lower crime rates may be also connected with growing immigrant population. According to American Immigration Council, immgrants are less likely to commit a crime and to be incancerated than native-borns.The foreign-born population in California has been growing from 8.8% in 1970 to 27.2% in 2020 (https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/criminalization-immigration-united-states).
